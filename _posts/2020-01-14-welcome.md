Jekyll requires blog post files to be named according to the following format:

`YEAR-MONTH-DAY-filename.md`

Where `YEAR` is a four-digit number, `MONTH` and `DAY` are both two-digit numbers, and `filename` is whatever file name you choose, to remind yourself what this post is about. The first line of the file should start with a single hash character, then a space, then your title. This is how you create a "level 1 heading" in markdown. Then you can create level 2, 3, etc headings as you wish but repeating the hash character, such as you see in the line "## Nice to meet you" above.
